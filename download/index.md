## Github repository

The core library handling the basic SAML stuff (messages, bindings, and so on) has been
detached from SimpleSAMLphp, and can now be found in github:

* [simplesamlphp/saml2](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/saml2)

SimpleSAMLphp itself has been moved to github too, and you will find it here:

* [simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp)

Make sure you follow the
[instructions to install from the repository](https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/development/simplesamlphp-install-repo).

## Debian package

SimpleSAMLphp is available as a Debian package. You can therefore install it with apt-get,
but bear in mind that the version available in Debian stable might be outdated. Therefore,
**we don't recommend using the Debian package**.
