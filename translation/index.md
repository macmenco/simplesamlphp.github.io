# Translation

Please help translating simpleSAMLphp to your language! 

We have a dedicated portal for simpleSAMLphp translation into multiple languages.


* [Visit the translation portal - and start your contribution (or just view the statistics)](https://translation.rnd.feide.no)
* [Join the simpleSAMLphp translation mailing-list if you are interested in contributing with translating simpleSAMLphp](/lists)

You can login with Feide RnD OpenIdP (more identity providers will be added soon), and start translate right away. You can add missing terms or improve the current ones.

To add brand new languages contact us, and we will add a new empty template so you can start translating!

The start page shows statistics and the status of all the current languages.
